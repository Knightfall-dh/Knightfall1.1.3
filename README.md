#### Step 1: Wabbajack  
[Wabbajack.org](https://www.wabbajack.org)  
Around 55 GB of free space is needed for Knightfall.  
Here we create a new empty Folder called Wabbajack.  
Create the folder near the root level of your drive.  
For example: `D:/moddedgames/Wabbajack`     
Go to Wabbajack.org and press download.   
Copy the Wabbajack.exe into the new empty Folder, and Install it.     
You can close Wabbajack after successfully launching it.  
<br/>

#### Step 2: Knightfall   
[Microsoft Edge WebView2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=2124703)  
Create a new empty Folder called Knightfall.  
Download Knightfall.wabbajack, and run it.  
Set the `Modlist Installation Location` (Middle column, three dots)  
and point it to Knightfalls empty Folder.  
The Download location should automatically fill in.  
Press the Start button.  
  
*Wabbajack opens a log-in screen to Nexus, if you get a BLACK SCREEN, download Microsoft Edge WebView2*  
  
After successfully login, Wabbajack will point you to different downloads on Nexus.  
Estimated download time for Knightfall is 3.5 hours with 3mb/s  
Close Knightfall.wabbajack after Installation. 
<br/>
```

Troubleshoot Knightfall
There are many reasons why Wabbajack is failing. First, you should close Knightfall.wabbajck and rerun it.  
Wabbajack will pick up where you left, so no progress will be lost.  
If some mod files get deleted, you will get an error massage. 
In that case you have to wait until Knightfall gets updated.

#### Step 3: MCM Settings

Confirm, and replace the files, when asked.

#### Step 5: Update Knightfall
<br/>
Before we update, we have to use Root Builder and clear our game files. 

![](https://github.com/Knightfall-dh/Knightfall1.1.3/blob/main/images/clear.gif)

Wabbajack will delete all files that are not part of the Modlist when updating!  
This means that any additional mods you have installed on top of the Modlist will be deleted.  
Your downloads folder will not be touched!  
Updating is like installing.  
You only have to make sure that you select the same path and tick the `overwrite existing Modlist` button.  
##### You probably have to start a new game after updating.
