# Knightfall: A Bannerlord Wabbajack Mod List   
  
WJ = Wabbajack  
  
  
## Introduktion:  
  
Knightfall is catering towards players, who are looking for a challenge.   
As a base, we have Realistic Battle Mod and for early and mid-game we have Hardcore Lord. 
  
In the year of our Lord 1259.  
Wrongly accusations of heresy spreads like wildfire across Europe.  
You got excommunicated from the Catholic Church, and are outlawed across the known world.  
You barely escaped the Inquisition and certain death by Burning at the stake.  
Will you try to rehabilitate yourself in the Holy Land and become a Knight,  
or will you be a feared Heretic and leader of reballions.  
Now it's up to you.    
  
************************************************************************************************************
## To-Do-List:  
  
You need a clean **Bannerlord Installation**, that means:  
  
- No Mods in your Modules Folder   
- No Game file changes, no Launcher, no BLSE exe. etc   
- No Steam Workshop mods, you have to unsubscribe all of them.   
- 55 GB of free ssd space.   
- Microsoft .NETFramework 6.0 (You get pointed to it in the Installation process)   
- Microsoft Edge WebView2 (is requierd for Wabbajack)   
- If you have a fresh Bannerlord Installation, you should run it once and enter the Main Menu.

## Installation:  
  
#### Step 1: Wabbajack  
[Wabbajack.org](https://www.wabbajack.org)  
  
Around 55 GB of free space is needed for Knightfall.  
Here we create a new empty Folder called Wabbajack.  
Try to create the WJ folder near the root level of your drive.  
For example: `D:/Wabbajack`     
Go to Wabbajack.org and download WJ.   
Copy WJ into the new empty Folder, and Install it.   
After installation, one .bat File and one Folder got created inside of WJ's Folder.  
You can close WJ after successfully launching it.  
  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
#### Step 2: Knightfall   

[Microsoft Edge WebView2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=2124703)  
  
Create a new empty Folder called Knightfall.  
Download Knightfall.wabbajack, copy it into the WJ Folder, and run it.  
Set the `Modlist Installation Location` (Middle column, three dots)  
and point it to Knightfalls empty Folder.  
The Download location should automatically fill in.  
Press the Start button.  
  
*WJ opens a log-in screen to Nexus, if you get a BLACK SCREEN, download Microsoft Edge WebView2*  
  
After successfully login, WJ will point you to different downloads on Nexus.  
Estimated download time for Knightfall is 3.5 hours with 3mb/s  
Close Knightfall.wabbajack after Installation.  

```  
Troubleshoot Knightfall

There are many reasons why WJ is failing. First, you should close WJ and rerun it.  
WJ will pick up where you left, so no progress will be lost.  
If some mod files get deleted, you will get an error massage. 
In that case you have to wait until Knightfall gets updated.

```  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
#### Step 3: MCM Settings  
 
  
Download the File and unzip it.  
Copy the config folder into `C:\Users\win10\Documents\Mount and Blade II Bannerlord`   
Don't forget to back up your save files.   
Confirm, and replace the files, when asked.      
  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
#### Step 4: Start Bannerlord  
[Microsoft .NETFramework 6.0](https://download.visualstudio.microsoft.com/download/pr/85473c45-8d91-48cb-ab41-86ec7abc1000/83cd0c82f0cde9a566bae4245ea5a65b/windowsdesktop-runtime-6.0.16-win-x64.exe)

Open the Knightfall Folder and Navigate to the Knightfall.exe and double-click it.    
After Launching Mod Organizer, press the RUN button on the left side.  
Novus Launcher opens.  
Press Play!  

*************************************************************************************************************
#### Step 5: Update Knightfall

Wabbajack will delete all files that are not part of the Modlist when updating!  
This means that any additional mods you have installed on top of the Modlist will be deleted.  
Your downloads folder will not be touched!  
Updating is like installing.  
You only have to make sure that you select the same path and tick the `overwrite existing Modlist` button.  
##### You probably have to start a new game after updating.

*************************************************************************************************************

#### Tip 1:  

Download the Knightfall Manual for Mod highlights and MCM Setting changes.  

#### Tip 2:  

If Hardcore Lord is too difficult, disable it in Mod Organizer it is near the bottom of the Mod List.
